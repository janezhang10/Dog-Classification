# Dog-Classification
A program that was trained on images of dogs and humans that accepts any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. This is a project that I worked on for the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree course on Udacity
